# Tutorial -- Finding Required mdJSON Elements
---

In this image of the <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> <span class="md-section">Main</span> section all the panels have been collapsed.  I have done this to make our discussion easier to follow, but it's not necessary for you to do this in completing the exercise.

There are several ways to find the required elements on any <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> section.  Remember the icons on the <span class="md-window">Panel Title Bars</span>?  The icons remind us we need to visit each panel with a red asterisk <i class="fa fa-asterisk required"> </i> to fill in the panel's required elements and that we need to add at least one object to panels with a red zero ![](/assets/bullets/count-red.png).  

Alternatively, we can click the orange exclamation mark ![](/assets/bullets/bang-orange.png) next to the window's title to get a list of all missing and erroneous mdJSON elements as detected by mdEditor.
