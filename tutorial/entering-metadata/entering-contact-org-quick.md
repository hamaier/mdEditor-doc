{% endhint %}

## Organization Contact

The "Organization" contact record collects pertinent contact information for an organization such as name, address, phone numbers, email addresses, etc.  There are two required elements for "Organization" contact: <span class="md-element">Contact ID</span> and <span class="md-element">Name</span>.

### Contact ID <i class="fa fa-asterisk required" title="Required"> </i>

Each contact is assigned a unique ID.  This is the ID used to link this contact with one or more of your metadata and dictionary records.  When you create a new contact record a UUID is assigned to <span class="md-element">Contact ID</span> automatically.  However, if you prefer to use your own system for contact IDs, this would be the best time and place to change the ID. 

### Name <i class="fa fa-asterisk required" title="Required"> </i>

<span class="md-element">Name</span> is the name of the organization or group.  

{% hint style='working' %}
  Create an "Organization" contact record
  * Enter "CID002" as the <span class="md-element">Contact ID</span>
  * Enter your organization's name in <span class="md-element">Name</span>
  * Click <strong><span class="btn btn-success btn-xs"> <i class="fa fa-floppy-o"> </i> Save</span></strong>
{% endhint %}

As we saw when adding the individual contact record in the previous exercise, our organization contact is valid after adding just the two elements.  We can return later to fill in the optional information about this contact, but for now let's get back to editing our metadata record.
