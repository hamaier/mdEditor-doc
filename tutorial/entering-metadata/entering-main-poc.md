# Tutorial -- Entering Points Of Contact 
---

As your trained eye can now see, <span class="md-panel">Points of Contact</span> is another array-panel containing <span class="md-panel">Points of Contact</span> objects.  So, let's add our first Point of Contact.

{% hint style='working' %}
  Add a Point of Contact:
  * Click the <strong class="btn btn-info btn-xs"> <i class="fa fa-plus"> </i> Add</strong> button to "Add" a new object to the array.
{% endhint %}

<span class="md-panel">Points of Contact</span> has two elements, <span class="md-element">Role</span> and <span class="md-element">Contacts</span>.  Both are required. 

{% hint style='info' %}
  Throughout mdEditor, and its underlying mdJson files, contacts are assigned via "responsibilities".  A responsibility associates a functional <span class="md-element">Role</span> with one or more individual and/or organization <span class="md-element">Contacts</span>.  In our current context for "Point of Contact", a person or organization (contact) is designated as the point-of-contact for a particular topic (role).  Example, "Contact John or Mary (contacts) for information about the project's funding (role)."
{% endhint %}

### Role <i class="fa fa-asterisk required" title="Required"> </i>

<span class="md-element">Role</span> describes the specific area of responsibility for contact(s).  The control allows you to select from a list of predefined roles or to add a custom role of your own.  

### Contacts <i class="fa fa-asterisk required" title="Required"> </i>

<span class="md-element">Contacts</span> is a multi-select control that allows you to select one or more contacts you currently have loaded in mdEditor.

But wait!  We haven't defined any contacts yet!  We can't complete the <span class="md-panel">Points of Contact</span> requirement until we first define a contact or two.  

This is a situation you will likely encounter rather frequently while entering and editing real metadata, so we made sure you would get the chance to practice this during the exercise.  You can thank us later. 

{% hint style='working' %}
  Create a contact on the fly:
  * Save your work.  If you have AutoSave set to "Off" click the <span class="btn btn-success btn-xs"> <i class="fa fa-floppy-o"> </i> Save</span> button in <span class="md-window">Record Management</span> block of the <span class="md-window">Secondary Sidebar</span>.  If AutoSave is "On", your record is already saved.
  * Click the plus sign (+) next to Contacts in the <span class="md-window">Primary Sidebar</span> to create a new contact. 
  * Continue to the next page to complete adding the new Contact record.
{% endhint %}
