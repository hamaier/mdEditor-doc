# Tutorial -- Resume Entering Points Of Contact 
---

Now that we have created a few contacts, let's pick up where we left off editing "My First Metadata Record."  The first order of business will be to get mdEditor refocused on the <span class="md-panel">Points Of Contact</span> panel on the <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> <span class="md-section">Main</span> section.

{% hint style='working' %}
  Open "My First Metadata Record" to <span class="md-panel">Points of Contact</span>
  * Click the <strong class="btn btn-warning btn-xs"> <i class="fa fa-pencil"> </i></strong> button for "My First Metadata Record"
  * Click <span class="md-panel">Points of Contact</span> button in the <span class="md-window">Secondary Sidebar</span> <span class="md-window">Fast Scrolling</span> menu to move the panel to the top of the window
{% endhint %}

Now add a new <span class="md-panel">Points of Contact</span> object.  

{% hint style='working' %}
  Add a <span class="md-panel">Point Of Contact</span>
  * Click the <strong class="btn btn-info btn-xs"> <i class="fa fa-plus"> </i> Add</strong> button to both add a new <span class="md-panel">Point Of Contact</span> object and expand the array-panel
{% endhint %}

Your mdEditor screen should look very similar to the following:

{% hint style='working' %}
  Edit the new <span class="md-panel">Point of Contact</span>
  * Click in the <span class="md-element">Role</span> selector control and choose "administrator"
  * Click in the <span class="md-element">Contacts</span> selector and choose the individual contact you created in the previous step
{% endhint %}

The metadata requirement for <span class="md-panel">Points of Contact</span> has been fulfilled.  But let's add a second <span class="md-panel">Points of Contact</span> object to observe how these array panels work.

{% hint style='working' %}
  Add a second <span class="md-panel">Points of Contact</span> object
  * Click the <strong class="btn btn-info btn-xs"> <i class="fa fa-plus"> </i> Add</strong> button
  * Click in the <span class="md-element">Role</span> selector control and choose "funder"
  * Click in the <span class="md-element">Contacts</span> selector and choose the organization contact created in the previous step 
{% endhint %}

{% hint style='info' %}
  Notice the object count has increased to two in the blue circle on the panel title bar, reflecting the actual object count. 
{% endhint %}

{% hint style='tip' %}
  The object count can also be found in the panel's content space.  Each panel object is preceded by a number that represents its position in the array.  Note that the position number starts with zero rather than one.  It's a computer thing.   
{% endhint %}

OK, on to "Citation" ...
