# Tutorial -- Secondary Navigation Bar
---

The <span class="md-window">Secondary Navigation Bar</span> buttons allow you to jump between major sections of the <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span>.  The button for the currently active edit section will be highlighted orange.  Notice that in the image below <span class="md-section">Main</span> is highlighted as this is currently the active section displayed in the <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span>.

  Click one of the other buttons in the <span class="md-window">Secondary Navigation Bar</span> to jump to that section.  Then return to the <span class="md-section">Main</span> section.  We will discuss the details of each <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> section later in this document.  For now, we will stay on the <span class="md-section">Main</span> section.
