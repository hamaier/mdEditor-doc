# Tutorial -- Fast Scrolling
--- 

Some <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> sections are too long to fit on a standard monitor and require some scrolling to see all the elements of the page.  The Edit Window can get even longer as you continue to add your metadata.  This can make it inconvenient to locate just the information you're looking for by visually searching the record.

To assist with quickly displaying the portion of the page you need, the <span class="md-window">Fast Scrolling</span> feature was added to the <span class="md-window">Secondary Sidebar</span>.  This facility provides links to quickly scroll the panel you need to the top of the <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span>.  In addition, the window's current scroll position is highlighted in the <span class="md-window">Secondary Sidebar</span>.

The <span class="md-window">Fast Scrolling</span> buttons are named for the panels in the <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> section.  Clicking on a <span class="md-window">Fast Scrolling</span> button will scroll the selected panel to the top of the window, saving you the search.  Scrolling the window manually also highlights the <span class="md-window">Fast Scrolling</span> button for the <span class="md-window">Edit Window's</span> top-most panel, providing visual confirmation of the window's scroll position.

  Browser scrolling behavior presents a full page whenever possible.  Therefore, when a <span class="md-window">Fast Scrolling</span> button near the bottom of the list is clicked (e.g. 'Graphic Overview' in the above image), that panel will scroll as close to the top of the page as possible while still presenting a full page on your monitor.  The <span class="md-window">Fast Scrolling</span> button for the top-most panel will be highlighted, which may not be the one you clicked. This behavior may vary by browser.

  * Scroll the window and watch the highlighting of the <span class="md-window">Fast Scrolling</span> buttons change.  Observe the pairing of the highlighted <span class="md-window">Fast Scrolling</span> button and the <span class="md-window">Edit Window's</span> top panel.
  * Click on a few of the <span class="md-window">Fast Scrolling</span> buttons and observe page scrolling.

  Each <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> section will have a unique <span class="md-window">Fast Scrolling</span> section that matches up with the panels for that <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> section.  However, some <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> sections have only a few or even no panels, so not all <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> sections will have a <span class="md-window">Fast Scrolling</span> feature in the <span class="md-window">Secondary Sidebar</span>.
