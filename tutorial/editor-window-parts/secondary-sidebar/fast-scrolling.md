# Tutorial -- Fast Scrolling

---

Some <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> sections are too long to fit on a standard monitor and require some scrolling to see all the elements of the page.  The Edit Window can get even longer as you continue to add your metadata.  This can make it inconvenient to locate just the information you're looking for by visually searching the record.

To assist with quickly displaying the portion of the page you need, the <span class="md-window">Fast Scrolling</span> feature on the <span class="md-window">Secondary Sidebar</span> provides links to quickly scroll the panel you need to the top of the <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span>.

The <span class="md-window">Fast Scrolling</span> buttons are named for the panels in the <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> section.  Clicking on a <span class="md-window">Fast Scrolling</span> button will scroll the selected panel to the top of the window, saving you the search.

Browser scrolling behavior presents a full page whenever possible.  Therefore, when a <span class="md-window">Fast Scrolling</span> button near the bottom of the list is clicked (e.g. 'Graphic Overview' in the above image), that panel will scroll as close to the top of the page as possible while still presenting a full page on your monitor.  The feature is made to work with the userâ€™s native screen size.  Note, that on some smaller screens the sidebar may place itself in a fixed position to accommodate the display area.

Each <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> section will have a unique <span class="md-window">Fast Scrolling</span> section that matches up with the panels for that <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> section.  However, some <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> sections have only a few or even no panels, so not all <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> sections will have a <span class="md-window">Fast Scrolling</span> feature in the <span class="md-window">Secondary Sidebar</span>.
