# Tutorial -- Metadata Edit Window
---

And finally, the **big kahuna**, the <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span>!  The <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> is where all metadata entry and editing takes place.  While the buttons and controls described to this point deal primarily with records, the <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> gets down to working with individual metadata elements.  

Let's begin by describing the plethora of buttons and informational icons on the <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span>.  I have collapsed the panels on my <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> screen to make the buttons and icons we are discussing more visible.

Notice that in general, information icons appear on the left hand side of <span class="md-window">Panel Title Bars</span> following the panel title.  Buttons appear on the right side of the <span class="md-window">Panel Title Bars</span>.  Both the icons and buttons pertain only to the contents of their respective panels.  

Let's divide up the introduction of icons and buttons and discuss each separately over the next few pages.
