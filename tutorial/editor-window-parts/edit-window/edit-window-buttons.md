### ![](/assets/bullets/isolation-dot.png) Isolate Panel

Some panels, and even sub-panels (panels within panels), have an 'Isolate' button.  Clicking this will visually isolate the panel and all its elements from the surrounding data by dimming information not in scope, making it easier to focus on relevant content.  When you are ready to return a normal view of the <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span>, click on the 'Isolate' button once again, or click simply click anywhere off the isolated panel.  In the example below the <span class="md-panel">Basic Information</span> panel has been isolated.  Notice also that <span class="md-panel">Default Locale</span> is a sub-panel that can be further isolated should you choose.

### <strong class="btn btn-info btn-sm"> <i class="fa fa-plus"> </i> Add</strong> Add New Object

Clicking the 'Add' button on a <span class="md-window">Panel Title Bar</span> will add a new object to the panel.  The new object can then be edited as needed.

### <strong class="btn btn-success btn-sm"> <i class="fa fa-pencil"> </i> Edit</strong> Edit Object

An 'Edit' button will appear on <span class="md-window">Panel Title Bars</span> of panel objects when the object contains more elements than can be presented in the current window without creating clutter.  

Clicking the 'Edit' button will navigate you to a new window where the object can be edited on its own.  After making your edits, click the <strong class="btn btn-info btn-xs"> <i class="fa fa-check"> </i> OK</strong> button to bring you back to where you initiated the edit. The 'OK' button may appear at the top, bottom, or both of the object edit window.  As an example of how this works, let's look at the <span class="md-panel">Citation</span>.

{% hint style='working' %}
  Edit the <span class="md-panel">Citation</span> 
  * On the <span class="md-panel">Citation</span> <span class="md-window">Panel Title Bar</span> click <strong class="btn btn-success btn-xs"> <i class="fa fa-pencil"> </i> Edit</strong>.  You should see the <span class="md-window">Citation Edit Window</span> pictured below.
{% endhint %}

There are a few things to notice on the above window.

  * The <span class="md-window">Edit Window Title</span> has changed to indicate you are now editing a citation object. 
  * The <span class="md-window">Fast Scrolling</span> buttons have changed to reflect the panels of the <span class="md-window">Citation Edit Window</span> rather than the <span class="md-section">Main</span> section.
  * There is a new button in <span class="md-window">Record Management</span> area of the <span class="md-window">Secondary Sidebar</span>, <strong class="btn btn-primary btn-xs"><i class="fa fa-arrow-left"> </i> Back to Main</strong>.  

{% hint style='working' %}
  Click the <strong class="btn btn-primary btn-xs"><i class="fa fa-arrow-left"> </i> Back to Main</strong> button now to return to the <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> <span class="md-section">Main</span> section. 
{% endhint %}

Above we discussed that clicking the <strong class="btn btn-info btn-xs"> <i class="fa fa-plus"> </i> Add</strong> button will add another object to a panel.  Below is an example of an array-type panel with a second object added.  To manage the objects independently, several buttons are added to each object.

![Array Panel with Multiple Objects](/assets/tutorial/edit-window-array-panel.png){caption}

### <strong class="btn btn-success btn-sm"> <i class="fa fa-pencil"> </i> Edit</strong> Edit Array Object

When an 'Edit' button appears next to a panel object, clicking it will expand the object for editing.  After editing, click the <strong class="btn btn-info btn-xs"> <i class="fa fa-check"> </i> OK</strong> button to hide the object's detail and restore the <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span>.

### <strong class="btn btn-danger btn-sm"> <i class="fa fa-times"> </i> Delete</strong> Delete Array Object

The 'Delete' button adjacent to an object is used to remove the object from the array. After clicking 'Delete' the button will change to <strong class="btn btn-danger btn-xs"> <i class="fa fa-question"> </i> Confirm</strong>.  Clicking 'Confirm' will complete the delete operation.

Okay!  That's probably enough orientation to the <span class="md-window">Edit Window's</span> sections, buttons, and icons.  Time to get some actual work done.  So let's return to filling in our minimal metadata record.
