# Tutorial -- Closing Thoughts

---

Congratulations! Unless you just skipped directly to this page you have now completed the "Getting Started" guided tour of mdEditor. Admittedly, there are still many details yet to cover. mdEditor is a very rich metadata editor. The reference pages  attempt to cover this full feature set. So don't close the book just yet. Keep a link to this document handy for when you have a question or need to do something new such as add a map, a dictionary, or other feature not explored in the "Getting Started" tutorial.
