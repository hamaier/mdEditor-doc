# Tutorial -- Welcome to the mdEditor Tutorial

---

This short "mdEditor Tutorial" is designed to provide you with an overview of the mdEditor layout, features, and workflow.  It will not get into great detail about any single feature, that can be found in the [Reference](../reference/reference-manual.md) section when you are ready.  In this tutorial we will work step-by-step through creating, editing, exporting, importing, and translating a simple metadata record. 

All that is required to take this tutorial is a current internet browser - the same one you are viewing this document in will work just fine - a color monitor, and about an hour of your time. 

{% hint style='tip' %}
  Many pages of mdEditor are capable of displaying quite a lot of information.  We recommend a screen size of 1200x1080 or better.  mdEditor will work with smaller screen sizes but the layout may be altered from screenshots in this document.
