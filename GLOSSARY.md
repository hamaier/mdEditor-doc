## Auto-Save

A feature in mdEditor settings that allows information to be automatically saved as it is entered. Consult the Settings section of this manual for more information.

## Browser Cache

A temporary storage area in memory or on disk that holds the most recently downloaded Web pages.  mdEditor exploits this non-volatile memory facility of browsers to cache metadata records while they are being edited.

## CSV

A comma-separated values (CSV) file is a delimited text file that uses commas to separate values. A CSV file stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain text. Each line of the file is a data record. Each data record consists of one or more fields separated by a comma. The fields most commonly represent the columns in a record. CSV fields generally use the .csv extension.

## Customization

The ability afforded by open-source code to edit the code of an application (in this case mdEditor) according to the needs of the users.

## FGDC CSDGM

Federal Geographic Data Committee’s Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata - FGDC-STD-001-1998 (Includes Biological Data Profile) [https://www.fgdc.gov/metadata/csdgm/](https://www.fgdc.gov/metadata/csdgm/)

## FGDC

## HTML

Hyper Text Markup Language, the standard markup language for creating Web pages. HTML is the ‘human-readable’ and printable report of the metadata content.

## International Standards Organization

International Organization for Standardization - ISO is an independent, non-governmental international organization with a membership of 162 [national standards bodies](https://www.iso.org/members.html).

Through its members, it brings together experts to share knowledge and develop voluntary, consensus-based, market relevant international standards that support innovation and provide solutions to global challenges. [https://www.iso.org/home.html](https://www.iso.org/home.html)

## ISO 19110

International Standards Organization Geographic Information - Feature Catalogue 19110:2005. more ...

ISO 19110:2005 defines the methodology for cataloguing feature types and specifies how the classification of feature types is organized into a feature catalogue and presented to the users of a set of geographic data.
 (International Organization for Standardization (2016). **ISO 19110:2016** [https://www.iso.org/standard/57303.html](https://www.iso.org/standard/57303.html)). 
 
ADIwg mdJSON and mdEditor use this standard to describe tabular datasets in ISO metadata records.  It is not a perfect fit, but it is all that is available for data descriptions in ISO metadata.  

## ISO 19115-1

International Standards Organization Geographic Information - Metadata 19115-1:2014. more ...

Defines the schema required for describing geographic information and services by means of metadata. It provides information about the identification, the extent, the quality, the spatial and temporal aspects, the content, the spatial reference, the portrayal, distribution, and other properties of digital geographic data and services. (International Organization for Standardization (2014). **ISO 19115-1:2014**. Retrieved from: [https://www.iso.org/standard/53798.html](https://www.iso.org/standard/53798.html))

## ISO 19115-2

International Standards Organization Geographic Information - Metadata 19115-2:2009. more ...

Extends the existing geographic metadata standard by defining the schema required for describing imagery and gridded data. It provides information about the properties of the measuring equipment used to acquire the data, the geometry of the measuring process employed by the equipment, and the production process used to digitize the raw data. This extension deals with metadata needed to describe the derivation of geographic information from raw data, including the properties of the measuring system, and the numerical methods and computational procedures used in the derivation. The metadata required to address coverage data in general is addressed sufficiently in the general part of ISO 19115.  (International Organization for Standardization (2009). ISO 19115-2:2009. Retrieved from: [https://www.iso.org/standard/39229.html](https://www.iso.org/standard/39229.html))

## JSON

Javascript Object Notation, a general purpose format like CSV.

## Keywords

Words used in an information retrieval system to indicate the content of a document.

## Local Storage

The user's standard storage system of directories, files, and folders.  Local Storage may be on a user's hard drive or SSD (Solid State Device).  In this document the term Local Storage is also meant to include any network storage accessible by the user.

## Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name.

## mdEditor File

A mdJSON file created by mdEditor that contains all of the information contained in mdJSON, along with mdEditor settings. This can be exported and shared with collaborators, imported into another record set, or saved to a local workstation as a backup or archival copy.

## mdEditor

Web application for authoring and editing metadata, for both projects and datasets.

## mdJSON File

An mdJSON file that is proprietary to the Metadata toolkit developed by the Alaska Data Integration Working Group (ADIwg), learn more at [https://adiwg.github.io/mdTools/](https://www.gitbook.com/book/adiwg/mdeditor/edit#).

## mdJSON

ADIwg standard for encoding project and data metadata, based on JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).

## mdTranslator

Open-source Ruby software application for translating between metadata standards. Metadata is input in one of the supported ‘reader’ formats and output in one of the supported ‘writer’ formats. Available as Ruby gem or Command-Line-Interface.

## Memory

The volatile high-speed RAM (Random Access Memory) that is the temporary working storage for all computer applications and data.  Once a unit of work is complete it must be moved to a non-volatile storage area such as browser cache or local storage to be saved for later access.  Once an application is closed its memory space is cleared to be used by other applications.

## Metadata Repository

A server where metadata is published.

## Metadata

A set of data that describes and gives information about other data.

## Record

In mdJSON records can be one of three types; metadata record, contact, or dictionary.  All records that have been loaded into browser cache can be accessed from the <span class="md-window">Primary Sidebar</span>.    

## sbJSON

U.S. Geological Survey’s standard for documenting records ingested into ScienceBase Catalog. The format used to define the attributes of ScienceBase items.

## ScienceBase

A USGS collaborative scientific data and information management platform used directly by science teams. ScienceBase provides access to aggregated information derived from many data and information domains, including feeds from existing data systems, metadata catalogs, and scientists contributing new and original content. ScienceBase architecture is designed to help science teams and data practitioners centralize their data and information resources to create a foundation needed for their work. ScienceBase, both original software and engineered components, is released as an open source project to promote involvement from the larger scientific programming community both inside and outside the USGS. (USGS (2018). _About ScienceBase._ Retrived from: [https://www.sciencebase.gov/about/content/about-sciencebase](https://www.sciencebase.gov/about/content/about-sciencebase)).

## UUID

A UUID (Universal Unique Identifier) is a 128-bit number used to uniquely identify an object on the Internet. A UUID is either guaranteed to be different or is, at least, extremely likely to be different from any other UUID generated until 3400 A.D.

## URI

Uniform Resource Identifier; a string of characters used to identify a resource. A URL is a type of URI.
