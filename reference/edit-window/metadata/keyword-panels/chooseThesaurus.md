### Choose a Thesaurus Type

Each <span class="md-panel">Keyword</span> list is assigned a "Thesaurus #' number starting with zero (0).  The Thesauri numbers for a <span class="md-panel">Metadata Record</span> are always in sequence.  When a <span class="md-panel">Keyword</span> list is deleted the numbering sequence will be reordered after the deleted list has been removed. 
 
 The Thesaurus IDs are for convenience only. A quick scroll link to the <span class="md-panel">Keyword</span> panel is placed in the <span class="md-window">Secondary Sidebar</span> labeled with the thesaurus ID.  Clicking this button will move the chosen <span class="md-panel">Keyword</span> list to the top of the window, space permitting.

A new <span class="md-panel">Keyword</span> list is initiated by choosing 'Custom Thesaurus' or one of the predefined keyword thesauri from the thesaurus selection list.

Once a thesaurus has been selected you can add keywords to the newly created <span class="md-panel">Keyword</span> list in accordance with procedures for predefined or custom keyword lists.
