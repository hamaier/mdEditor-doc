### Thesaurus Edit Window

![Thesaurus Edit Window](/assets/reference/edit-objects/metadata/keyword/keyword-editWindow.png){caption}

 Two types of <span class="md-panel">Keyword</span> lists may be specified: *predefined* and *custom*.  When thesaurus information for predefined thesauri is inserted by mdEditor it cannot be edited by the user and the individual elements are disabled.  Likewise, keywords from a predefined thesaurus must be selected from the list provided by mdEditor and cannot be extended.  
 
 Conversely, custom thesauri require the user to enter both the thesaurus information and keywords.
 
 The <span class="md-panel">Keyword</span> panels may be collapsed to de-clutter the window by clicking the 'collapse panel icon' on the upper right corner of the panel.  Once collapsed, they can be expanded again by reversing the process.
