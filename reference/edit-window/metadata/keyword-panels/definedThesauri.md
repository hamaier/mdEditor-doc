### Predefined Thesauri

When one of the predefined thesauri is selected all the thesaurus information elements are automatically filled in for your convenience and accuracy.  The value of these elements cannot be changed, nor do they need to be.  

{% hint style='info' %}
  mdEditor maintains the values of predefined thesauri information elements and keywords.  However, once a <span class="md-panel">Keyword</span> list has been defined in a <span class="md-panel">Metadata Record</span> changes made to thesauri information elements or keywords in later releases of mdEditor will not be reflected in existing <span class="md-panel">Metadata Record</span>.
{% endhint %}

With all thesaurus information elements pre-filled, all that remains is to choose which keywords to associate with the <span class="md-panel">Keyword</span> list.  

<strong class="btn btn-success btn-xs"> <i class="fa fa-pencil">
 </i> Edit Keywords</strong> Click the 'Edit Keywords' button to show the list of available keywords.  For predefined thesauri only keywords from the predefined list can be selected.  User entries are not permitted.  mdEditor maintains these keyword lists in accordance with the thesaurus source and strives to keep them current.

The list of available keywords is shown on the left side of the screen, keywords that have been selected appear in the "Selected Keywords" list on the right.  In addition to appearing in the "Selected Keywords" list, selected keywords are highlighted in the available keywords list with a green background.  

The available keyword list can be a simple list of keywords or a hierarchy of keywords as shown in the above image.  When a keyword in a hierarchy is selected the full path is added to the "Selected Keyword" list.
