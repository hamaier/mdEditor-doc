# Metadata Record -- Lineage Section
---

The <span class="md-section">Lineage</span> section of the <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> is used to document the history of the resource.  In other words, the step-by-step actions taken from acquisition of source data through transformation and validation of intermediary data products to final assembly of the main resource.     

When no <span class="md-panel">Lineage</span> has been defined for the <span class="md-panel">Metadata Record</span> a large blue bar is displayed on the page declaring "No Lineage found."

After clicking one of the buttons you will be transferred to the <span class="md-panel">Lineage</span> <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> where you can complete data entry for the resource lineage.  

When one or more <span class="md-panel">Lineage</span> have been defined the <span class="md-section">Lineage</span> section window will look similar to the image below.
