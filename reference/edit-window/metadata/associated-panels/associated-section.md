# Metadata Record -- Associated Resource Section
---

The <span class="md-section">Associated Resource</span> section of the <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> is used to connect related resources.  For instance, multiple resources may be related through inheritance where the main resource is a product of some larger program, or was a project that yielded sub-projects the metadata author wishes to note. These, as well as other association types, can all be linked by means of the <span class="md-panel">Associated Resource</span>.   

When no <span class="md-panel">Associated Resources</span> have been defined for the <span class="md-panel">Metadata Record</span> a large blue bar is displayed on the page declaring "No Associated Resource found."
