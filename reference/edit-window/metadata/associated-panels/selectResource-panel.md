# Metadata Record -- Associated Resource Section
---

### Select a Resource

<span class="md-panel">Metadata Records</span> which were previously defined and are currently loaded into browser cache may be imported as <span class="md-panel">Associated Resources</span>.  The import process copies the imported <span class="md-panel">Metadata Record</span>'s main <span class="md-panel">Citation</span> to the <span class="md-panel">Associated Resource Citation</span>.  You will still need to manually select the <span class="md-element">Association Type</span> and <span class="md-element">Initiative Type</span> as discussed [previously](editWindow-panel.md) to complete the <span class="md-panel">Associated Resource</span> object.  

When the <strong class="btn btn-info btn-xs"> <i class="fa fa-check"> </i> Select a Record </strong> is clicked a selection list is displayed showing all <span class="md-panel">Metadata Records</span> currently loaded in browser cache.  

![Select an Associated Resource Panel](/assets/reference/edit-objects/metadata/associated/selectResource.png)

Clicking on any row in the selection list will immediately load that <span class="md-panel">Metadata Record</span>'s <span class="md-panel">Citation</span> object, no confirmation is requested.  

{% hint style='danger' %}
  If you inadvertently select the wrong <span class="md-panel">Metadata Record</span> you will need to remove it from the <span class="md-panel">Associated Resource</span> array at the top level of <span class="md-section">Associated Resource</span>.  Do not be tempted to click <strong class="btn btn-danger btn-xs"> <i class="fa fa-times"> </i> Delete </strong> button in the <span class="md-window">Secondary Sidebar</span> as this will delete the entire <span class="md-panel">Metadata Record</span> with no ability to recover.
