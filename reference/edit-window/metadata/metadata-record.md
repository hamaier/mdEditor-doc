# Reference -- Metadata Records 
---

In mdEditor, <span class="md-panel">Metadata Records</span> are edited and saved separately from <span class="md-panel">Contacts</span> and <span class="md-panel">Dictionary Records</span>.  This approach allows a <span class="md-panel">Metadata Record</span> to reuse <span class="md-panel">Contact</span> and <span class="md-panel">Dictionary Records</span> that were originally created for use with other <span class="md-panel">Metadata Records</span>, as well use the same <span class="md-panel">Contact</span> multiple times within the <span class="md-panel">Metadata Record</span> without reentering the <span class="md-panel">Contact</span>'s information.  

There is a lot of information that may be entered for a single <span class="md-panel">Metadata Record</span>, far too much for a single data entry page.  For that reason, the layout of the <span class="md-panel">Metadata Record</span> <span class="md-window">EditWindow</span> is divided into 13 sections.  Each section is accessed by clicking its section buttons in the <span class="md-window">Secondary Navigation Bar</span>.  The image below shows only the <span class="md-section">Main</span> section of the <span class="md-panel">Metadata Record</span> <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span>.
