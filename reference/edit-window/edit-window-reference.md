# Reference -- Edit Window 

---

In mdEditor, <span class="md-panel">Metadata Records</span>, <span class="md-panel">Contact Records</span> <span class="md-panel">Dictionary Records</span> are created and maintained separately.  This normalized format allows mdEditor to reference a contact multiple times within a single metadata record without restating the contact's information.  The approach also allows individual contacts and dictionaries to be incorporated into many metadata records.
