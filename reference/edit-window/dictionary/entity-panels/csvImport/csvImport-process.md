### CSV Import Process

New <span class="md-panel">Entities</span> can be created using the mdEditor CSV Import process.  The process is able to create an entity, along with its associated attributes and domains, in a single step.  However, not all entity, attribute, and domain elements are supported by the CSV import process.  Even some required elements cannot be captured from the CSV file, so additional editing is always required.  

{% hint style='info' %}
  Only one entity can be imported per CSV file.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style='tip' %}
  The CSV import process will save you time and typos if your entities are already in a tabular file such as a spreadsheet which can be quickly converted to CSV.  Otherwise building a preliminary CSV file may be more work than just entering the entity's information using the standard mdEditor entry panels.
{% endhint %}

Steps for importing an <span class="md-panel">Entity</span> from a CSV file:

#### 1. [Prepare the CSV file](csvImport-prepCSV.md)

#### 2. [Read the CSV file](csvImport-readCSV.md)

#### 3. [Prepare Entity for Import](csvImport-prepEntity.md)

#### 4. [Import Entity](csvImport-import.md)
