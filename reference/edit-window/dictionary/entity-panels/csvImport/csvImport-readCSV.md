Instead of clicking the <strong><span class="btn btn-success btn-xs"> <i class="fa fa-plus"> </i> Add Entity</span> </strong> button to create a new <span class="md-panel">Entity</span>, click the <strong><span class="btn btn-success btn-xs"> <i class="fa fa-sign-in"> </i> Import CSV</span> </strong> button in the <span class="md-window">Secondary Sidebar</span>.

You are presented with a large blue target to drag and drop a CSV entity file onto or to click then navigate to a CSV entity file. 
 
{% hint style='info' %}
  When using drag and drop method the target will turn green when mdEditor is ready to receive the CSV file.
{% endhint %}

When the sample CSV entity file illustrated above ("STATE") is dropped onto the target or selected for import the following entity will be STAGED FOR IMPORT in mdEditor.

  It is important to note that the entity including its domains and attributes are not yet created at this juncture.  They are only STAGED for import. Additional information must be added and existing information reviewed prior to actual import.
