### Attribute Detail

All <span class="md-panel">Attributes</span> are properties of an <span class="md-panel">Entity</span>.  Thus <span class="md-panel">Attributes</span> in mdEditor are defined from the <span class="md-panel">Attribute</span> array panel on the <span class="md-section">Entities</span> <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> for <span class="md-panel">Dictionary Records</span> (see the [Attribute Array section](../entity-panels/attribute-panel.md) for initial <span class="md-panel">Attribute</span> definition).  

As discussed in the [Attribute Array section](../entity-panels/attribute-panel.md), only the few *required* <span class="md-panel">Attribute</span> elements may be defined from the <span class="md-panel">Entity</span>'s <span class="md-panel">Attribute</span> array panel.  However, there are many additional <span class="md-panel">Attribute</span> elements that may be optionally defined from the <span class="md-panel">Attribute</span> <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span>.  These are discussed next.

In the example below, an <span class="md-panel">Entity</span> has been defined for vehicle registration records within a fictitious Department of Motor Vehicles database.  Several of the VEHICLE_REGISTRATION <span class="md-panel">Entity</span>'s <span class="md-panel">Attributes</span> are shown in the <span class="md-panel">Attribute</span> array panel along with their required elements.

Each <span class="md-panel">Attribute</span> has a <strong class="btn btn-success btn-xs"> <i class="fa fa-pencil"> </i> More...</strong> button that when clicked navigates to the <span class="md-panel">Attribute</span>'s <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> providing access to *all* the <span class="md-panel">Attribute</span>'s elements, optional and required. This <span class="md-panel">Attribute</span> <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span> is shown in the illustration below.  Each of the <span class="md-window">Edit Window</span>'s panels are discussed separately on the following pages.
