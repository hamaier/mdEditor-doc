# Settings
---

The <span class="md-window">Settings</span> window provides access for viewing and modifying all mdEditor settings and default values.  mdEditor settings are universal in that they apply to all <span class="md-panel">Metadata Records</span>, <span class="md-panel">Contacts</span>, and <span class="md-panel">Dictionaries</span> loaded in browser cache.  However, a change made to a default value will not effect any values already written in your metadata. 

The <span class="btn btn-default btn-sm"> <i class="fa fa-cog"> </i> Settings</span> button is available on the <span class="md-window">Primary Navigation Bar</span> from any window in mdEditor.

{% hint style='tip' %}
  Settings can be exported from the <span class="md-window">Export</span>  window.  In this way you can maintain one or more sets of settings and defaults to accommodate various metadata editing projects.
