  The file name assigned to the download file follows the form "*metadata record name*_" followed by a timestamp and a MIME type.  The MIME type will be either ".json", ".xml", or ".html" depending on the chosen metadata standard.  For example, translating "My First Metadata Record" into "ISO 19115-2 will create a file in your downloads similar to "My First Metadata Record_20181214.xml".  Note the timestamp is written using the format YYYYMMDD.  After download the files may be freely moved and renamed to fit your requirements.  Just make the sure to keep the MIME type suffix assigned to the download file.
