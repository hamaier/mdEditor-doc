# Publish -- USGS ScienceBase
### Requirements
---

Publishing requires the record to be a valid record, meaning that mdEditor checks that all required fields for a mdJSON file are present before allowing a record to be published.

Publishing requires every record to have a parent Identifier that identifies the ScienceBase folder where your record will be sent upon publishing. If you set up your Default Parent Identifier in <span class="md-window">Settings</span>, then you do not need to add a parent ID to your individual record. However, if you need to publish your record to a location different than your default folder, then you need to add a Parent ID to your metadata record (see Metadata/Parent Metadata.)

  Please use a testing folder before you update your real records. (Consult the Testing Publishing section of this manual for more information.)
