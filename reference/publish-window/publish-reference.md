Incorporated into mdEditor's design is the ability to export metadata records directly to metadata repositories and clearing houses that support an "Application Program Interface" \(API\).  These APIs are designed, written, and maintained by the repository owners, not by ADIwg and mdEditor support.  To establish the interface, mdEditor must implement the repository's API.

At this time the only supported repository is ScienceBase, the United States Geological Survey's data repository.  Because interface rules for each repository are different they are discussed individually.
