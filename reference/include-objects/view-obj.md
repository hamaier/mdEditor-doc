### View

Each export panel has built in support for navigating long lists of <span class="md-panel">Metadata Records</span>, <span class="md-panel"> Contacts</span>, and <span class="md-panel"> Dictionaries</span>.  The following functions are available for each panel.

  * #### Number of Items to Display
  
    This selection list allows you to set the maximum number of items to display in the panel.  The default is 10 items with options for 25, 50, and 500.  You cannot set your own number of items.
    
  * #### Record Controls
  
    The "Record Controls" manage which set of items is visible in the panel.  The controls become active when there are more items in browser cache than are displayed in the panel, given the limit set using the "Number of Items to Display" control (above).

    * ##### <i class="fa fa-forward"> </i> Next Page
  
    * ##### <i class="fa fa-backward"> </i> Previous Page
  
    * ##### <i class="fa fa-fast-forward"> </i> Last Page
  
    * ##### <i class="fa fa-fast-backward"> </i> First Page
    
  * #### Select Columns to Display
  
    Clicking this control presents a list of columns that can be displayed in the panel.  By default all available columns are displayed.  You can hide a column - or return it to visible again - by checking or un-checking the column name in the control's list.  The list of columns is naturally different between the <span class="md-panel">Metadata Records</span>, <span class="md-panel">Contacts</span>, and <span class="md-panel">Dictionaries</span> panels.
