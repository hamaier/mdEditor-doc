### Search

When there are many metadata records, contacts, or dictionaries loaded into the browser cache, the search capabilities of the page can help quickly narrow the number of items being considered.  

 * #### Search ALL Columns 
    Text entered into "Search All Columns" control will be matched against the contents of each column.  If the column value matches the search text, the item remains visible, otherwise the item is hidden.  All items in the browser cache will be searched, not just those currently visible in the panel. 
 
 * #### Search Column
   Immediately under each column header is the "Search A Column" control.  Text entered into this control is matched against the contents of that column only.  If the column value matches the search text, the item remains visible, otherwise the item is hidden.  All items in the browser cache will be searched, not just those currently visible in the panel.
