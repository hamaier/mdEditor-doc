# Reference -- Import Records 

### Clearing Browser Cache

---

When importing metadata records to mdEditor there are times when completely clearing the editor storage cache can be helpful. If your import is replacing items of each type (<span class="md-panel">Metadata Record</span>, <span class="md-panel">Contact</span>, and <span class="md-panel">Dictionary</span>) mdEditor will effectively be clearing browser cache for you. In other instances, you may need to do this yourself. 

To do this, go to the Settings page pictured below.

  **Clear Storage Cache:** To clear browser cache open the <span class="md-window">Settings</span> window and in the <span class="md-panel">General Settings</span> panel click the <span class="btn btn-danger btn-xs"> <i class="fa fa-times"> </i> Clear Storage Cache</span> button, then confirm.

{% hint style='warning' %} Note than when you clear the browser cache mdEditor (Settings General Settings), the option to keep your local settings is available. The option to “Keep Settings” is checked by default. This ensures that you will not lose your local settings unless you uncheck the box prior to using the Clear Storage Cache button. {% endhint %}

{% hint style='danger' %} Warning: Clearing all records will delete all of the records currently loaded in mdEditor. Before doing so, use the Export function to make a backup of your records. Otherwise, the records will be permanently lost (unless you previously made a backup copy). {% endhint %}
