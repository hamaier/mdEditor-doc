# Reference -- Import Records 
### Clearing Browser Cache
--- 

When importing metadata records to mdEditor there are times when completely clearing the browser cache can be helpful.  If your import is replacing items of each type (<span class="md-panel">Metadata Record</span>, <span class="md-panel">Contact</span>, and <span class="md-panel">Dictionary</span>) mdEditor will effectively be clearing browser cache for you.  In other instances you may need to do this yourself.  

{% hint style='danger' %}
  **Warning:** Clearing all records will delete all of the records currently loaded in mdEditor. Before doing so, use the Export function to make a backup of your records. Otherwise, the records will be permanently lost (unless you previously made a backup copy).
{% endhint %}
